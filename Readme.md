### CS 188 Summer 2022 Projects 

### Project 0: Python, Setup, & Autograder Tutorial
Project 0 will cover the following:
*Instructions on how to set up the right Python version,
*Workflow examples,
*A mini-Python tutorial,
*Project grading: Every project’s release includes its autograder for you to run yourself.

### Project 1: Search
In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

### Project 2: Multi-Agent Search
In this project, I designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, you will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.

### Project 3: Ghostbusters
Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacman’s great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.

### Project 4: Reinforcement Learning
In this project, you will implement value iteration and Q-learning. You will test your agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

### Project 5
This project will be an introduction to machine learning.
